BUBBLE SORT

BUBBLE SORT ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION 

The program takes array inputs from the user and then sorts it using the bubble sort algorithm.
The program uses an iterative approach whereby each element in the outer loop is compared with elements in the inner loop.Comparisons are done until the array is sorted.
This sorting is done in polynomial time - O(n)
